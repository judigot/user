Let's add a tasks folder in project-core. I want to be organized in my agentic AI workflow by using tasks and not rely on chat history and just winging everything. Add a task template. The agent should ignore it since it's just a template, but i wanna keep it so that i can just copy the folder for a new task. I want the task to support other files as well like images. Can you recommend some more files or task setup?
